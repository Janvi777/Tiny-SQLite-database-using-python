Tiny SQLite Database using Python

 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a lightweight database using Python and SQLite. It is designed for beginners and includes basic operations like creating tables, inserting data, reading records, updating entries, and deleting data using Python’s built-in sqlite3 module.

 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

SQLite (sqlite3 module)

OS module (for basic file handling)


 Key Features

Create and initialize a SQLite database

Perform all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

Simple and easy-to-understand code

Command-line based user interaction

No external dependencies required

 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Python 3 must be installed on your system

No additional libraries required


Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/janvi777/Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python.git


2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python


3. Run the script:
python main.py



How It Works

When the script runs, it checks whether the database file exists. If not, it creates a new one.

It provides options to perform operations like adding, viewing, updating, or deleting records.

SQL queries are executed using Python’s sqlite3 module.


 Educational Use

Ideal for students and beginners who want to:

Learn how databases work in Python

Practice SQL through Python

Build foundational knowledge for backend projects
